# Deep-Unfolded-PGD
This repository contains the source code for my MS.c project about Deep Unfolded Superposition Coding Optimization for Two-Hop NOMA MANETs.
GeneralNet.py contains all the relevant modules, and PGDNet_AUX.py provides all the needed functions. GeneralNetAnalysis will train the model according to the given specifications (such as the network's topology) and execute a comparison with the classic PGD algorithm.
